This is my app that is used for synchronizing with yandex.disk for not supported systems

THIS APP WILL NOT WORK UNTIL YOU REGISTER YOUR OWN OAUTH TOKEN ON https://yandex.ru/dev/oauth/

Then you need to have file SECRETS.txt which contains your client_id and client_secret separated with \n (new line)

If you have it then everything should be okay
